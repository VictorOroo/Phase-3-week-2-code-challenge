 # Phase-3-week-2-code-challenge
#### Created By Victor Oroo on August 27 2023

## Description

For this assignment, we'll be working with a Yelp-style domain.
 

We have three models:
- `Restaurant`
- `Customer`
- `Review`
 

For our purposes, a `Restaurant` has many `Reviews`, a `Customer` has many `Review`s, and a `Review` belongs to a `Customer` and to a `Restaurant`.
 

`Restaurant` - `Customer` is a many-to-many relationship.

Writing error-free code is more important than completing all of the deliverables listed - prioritize writing methods that work over writing more methods that don't work. You should test your code in the console as you write.
Similarly, messy code that works is better than clean code that doesn't. First, prioritize getting things working. Then, if there is time at the end, refactor your code to adhere to best practices. When you encounter duplicated logic, extract it into a shared helper method.
Before you submit! - Save and run your code to verify that it works as you expect. If you have any methods that are not working yet, feel free to leave comments describing your progress.
 

**Note**: You should draw your domain on paper or on a whiteboard _before you start coding_. Remember to identify a single source of truth for your data.
